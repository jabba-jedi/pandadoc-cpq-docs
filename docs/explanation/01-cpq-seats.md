# Understanding CPQ Seats in PandaDoc

CPQ Seats are assigned to users who need access to the **PandaDoc CPQ add-on capabilities**. These seats determine who can utilize advanced CPQ features, including:

## What Features Require a CPQ Seat?
A CPQ Seat is required for any user who needs access to the following tools:

- **Rules Engine** – Automate product selection, pricing adjustments, and approval workflows.
- **Workflows** – Streamline quote creation, approvals, and document generation.
- **Product and Pricing Configurators** – Enable guided selling and complex pricing structures.
- **Price Lists** – Manage regional or tiered pricing with pre-configured price books.
- **Templates and Documents** – Generate and customize quotes, proposals, and agreements leveraging CPQ functionalities.

## Who Needs a CPQ Seat?
Any user who actively **configures, builds, or generates quotes and workflows** using CPQ tools must have an assigned CPQ Seat. Users without a seat will not be able to **access or modify** CPQ-related functionality.

## Managing CPQ Seats
- CPQ Seats are **assigned at the account level** and can be allocated to individual users based on role requirements.
- If additional seats are needed, contact your **Account Team** for adjustments or upgrades.
