# Workflow Template vs. Workflow Run

Understanding the difference between a **workflow template** and a **workflow run** is essential for effectively using PandaDocâ€™s workflow feature. 

## Workflow Template

A **workflow template** is a **predefined blueprint** that outlines the steps and rules of a specific process. It serves as a **reusable framework**, ensuring that every workflow execution follows a standardized process. 

### **Key Characteristics of a Workflow Template**
- Defines **steps, rules, and data sources**.
- Standardizes processes for **repeatable tasks**.
- Ensures consistency across **clients and projects**.

For example, a workflow template might include steps for:
- Pulling data from a CRM.
- Generating a quote.
- Applying discount rules.
- Creating a final document.

### **Who Creates Workflow Templates?**
Workflow templates are typically created by **admins or operations teams**. These users design the template by specifying:
- Required **steps** (e.g., form input, quote creation, document generation).
- **Rules** for automating pricing, discounts, or approval flows.
- **Data sources** (e.g., CRM fields, manually entered data, or predefined variables).

Once a template is created, **team members can use it** to quickly generate documents or proposals without needing to manually configure each step.

## Workflow Run

A **workflow run** refers to the actual execution of a workflow **based on a template**. When a user starts a workflow, the predefined steps in the template are **applied to real-world data**, producing **customized documents or quotes**.

### **Key Characteristics of a Workflow Run**
- Executes a **specific instance** of a workflow template.
- Pulls **real-world data** (e.g., from a CRM, manual inputs).
- Generates **customized** proposals, contracts, or quotes.

For example, if a **workflow template** is set up to create proposals with product details and pricing from a CRM:
- A **workflow run** would pull actual customer data from the CRM.
- The workflow would generate a **proposal tailored to that customer**.
- The final document would be ready for **review and sending**.

### **Who Can Run Workflows?**
Any user with **a Member, Manager, or Admin role** can run workflows.  
For users with **custom roles**, the **"Run Workflows"** permission must be enabled.

## Summary Table

| Feature | Workflow Template | Workflow Run |
|---------|------------------|--------------|
| Purpose | Defines a **repeatable process** | Executes a **specific instance** of a template |
| Created by | **Admins, Operations Teams** | **Any authorized user** |
| Includes | **Steps, rules, data sources** | **Real-world data, document creation** |
| Example | A template for generating sales proposals | A proposal generated for a specific customer |

By understanding these differences, teams can **streamline** their document creation workflows, ensuring efficiency, accuracy, and consistency across all processes.
