# Setting Up Your Product Catalog in PandaDoc

## Step 1: Accessing the Product Catalog
To start defining your product catalog, navigate to the **Catalog** section in the main navigation menu. Here, you can manage your products, categories, and bundles.

## Step 3: Organizing Products into Categories
When dealing with a large product catalog, organizing items into categories enhances manageability. In this tutorial, we will create four main categories:
- **Additional Services**
- **Physical Products**
- **Security Subscriptions**
- **Security System Packages**

### Creating a Category
1. Go to the **Catalog** section.
2. Click on the **plus (+) button** next to Categories.
3. Enter the **category name** (e.g., Physical Products).
4. Click **Create**.

To assign products to a category:
1. Select multiple products in the catalog.
2. Move them into the appropriate category.

## Step 4: Configuring Subscription Products
Subscription products require additional settings for recurring payments.
1. When adding a subscription product, select **Recurring** instead of One-time payment.
2. Specify the **billing period** (e.g., Monthly).
3. Example:
   - **Name**: PandaShield Protect
   - **SKU**: PSP-001
   - **Price**: $29.99 per month
   - **Billing Frequency**: Monthly
4. Save the subscription product.

## Step 5: Creating Bundles
Bundles simplify selling groups of products together.
1. Select a product to convert into a bundle (e.g., Basic Security System).
2. Scroll down to **Product Bundle**.
3. Click **Add Products from Catalog**.

4. Select items to include in the bundle:
   - Remote Control
   - Keypad
   - Motion Detector
   - Door/Window Sensor
5. Click **Save**.

![Add Products to Bundle](/img/catalog/add_products_to_bundle.png)

By default, when you create a bundle, each included item has a quantity of **one**. You can adjust these quantities as needed, allowing customers to purchase multiple units within the bundle.

Additionally, bundles support different pricing models:
- **Sum of elements**: The total price is calculated as the sum of all included items.
- **Custom price**: The bundle has a fixed price, regardless of the prices of individual items.

For the Basic Security System bundle, we are using the **custom price model**, which means the prices of the included elements are ignored, and the total price is set at the bundle level.
